# HTTP

observables from RxJS. Library is inspired by Angular's HTTP service with a goal to provide framework-agnostic HTTP
client which can be used outside
Angular ecosystem.

- [@runopencode/http](packages/http/README.md) - HTTP client for JavaScript/TypeScript supporting observables from RxJS.
- [@runopencode/ngx-http-client](packages/ngx-http-client/README.md) - Angular's HTTP client adapter integration
  for `@runopencode/http`.
